  ## Goals

  My goal in building this project was to improve upon my original portfolio design which was built using React.

  ## Motivation

  Every programmer and developer needs a professional portfolio that they can use to advertise themself and their skills.  My last portfolio was sufficient but I wanted to build a new one and use a new technology to build it with.  I chose to learn Angular so not only have I ended up with a new resume but I've also ended up with an additional skill to be able to add to my resume. 

  ## Usage

  I intend to use this as my primary portfolio for the time being.  I plan to continue adding, improving and redesigning it as my knowledge and skills improve over time.

  ## Installation
  
  npm -i  

  ## Test

  ng test

  ## Problems

  The primary problems I faced came primarily from being new to the framework.  I did have a few issues getting the json server routes to show and display correctly but now additional items can be added directly to the json file without needing to hardcode it in or mess with styling. 

  ## Screenshots

This is the Welcome component that should load first upon page landing.

This is the About page that has more detailed personal information about me.

The Resume page has my education and extended work history as well as the button for the printable version of my resume.

On the Projects List page you can find the summarized information about all the projects that I have completed so far.

Once clicking on the individual project, the Project Details load which shows greater details and deployed links for each project.

I organized my Certificates and Proficiencies onto a single page so that it's a bit easier to read and see my qualifications.

  Please email me with any changes that you feel need to be made.

  ## Resources
 
  This portfolio uses Angular and Bootstrap as the framework and base styling.  Additional customized styling can be found on the individual style sheets.  The only other resource that I used was Canva to build the logos and icons. I opted to make my own instead of using from an online resource.
