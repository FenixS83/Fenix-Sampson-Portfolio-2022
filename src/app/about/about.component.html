            <br>
            <br>
            I’m currently looking for ways to expand my coding knowledge hopefully in a way that allows me to still spend time with my four-legged friends.  I have a couple dogs that would be absolutely devastated if I didn’t find time to take them for our normal walks.  If you are interested in getting my assistance with anything, please feel free to reach out to me.  I love my dogs but conversations with humans are always more productive.

        <h3>Bio #2</h3>
        <p>(for those who want a longer story)</p>
        <br>
        <p>Hi, I’m Fenix</p>
        <p>
            It’s a crazy sounding name but when your first name is “Terry” like your father and your middle name is “Huston” like your grandfather it can get a little confusing sometimes, so I’ve always preferred to go by “Fenix” (pronounced 'Phoenix' or 'fee-niks') instead.  I have always loved the two of them immensely, they have greatly influenced my character beyond just my names.  They both had a fondness for building and creating things.  From an early age they instilled that same lifelong obsession in me also.  My free time growing up was spent with a hammer in one hand and a piece of wood in the other.  I come from a southern family that lived with limited means which only helped to strengthen my creative resourcefulness. Anytime I needed something, my first thought was always “how can I build that?”  
            <br>
            <br>
    
            A higher college education was not an option for me in my youth so instead I entered the job field where I have gained valuable experience in many different areas.  For example, at Outback Steakhouse I learned what it means to truly lead people not just issue instructions and orders. Leading and coaching can have a much bigger and much longer lasting impression on someone than just barking commands at them.  I learned how to pay attention to the smallest details to make sure that every aspect of the dining environment was beyond expectations on a nightly basis. Hospitality was a word that took on a whole new definition for me. It wasn’t just a word to mean the entertainment of guests, for me it was an emotion, a feeling that you convey not by your words or even your actions but by the environment that you create.  One lesson that was taught to me that I tried to instill in every new hire was that hard work and determination could have profound and lasting consequences on people.

            <br>
            At Wells Fargo and Cadence Bank I learned the importance of being accurate and precise.  When people trust you with their finances you must be exact with every transaction for every customer every day.  There’s no room for inattention and errors.  A transposed number, a misplaced decimal, the wrong number of zero’s, any of these mishaps can cause major hassles and headaches for the customers who pay you to be a trusted steward of their money. I found that words, numbers and raw data were a major friend of mine.  I found great comfort in using them to ensure that with each interaction I was helping my customers to gain ever increasing trust in me and the company I was associated with.

            Starbucks taught me the importance of setting a high standard of quality for your product or service and then spending every day striving to improve upon yourself and raise those standards even higher.  While I was there, we believed that every day you should show your customers and guests standards of excellence that surpasses anything you had shown them previously.  There are many people in this world who equates the name “Starbucks” to so much more than a simple cup of coffee. The company motto is “To inspire and nurture the human spirit – one person, one cup, and one neighborhood at a time” and we truly went above and beyond to make that our reality.  We wanted our guests to think of us as their “third place” with home and work occupying the first two spots.  We strived to ensure that each guest felt as comfortable in our café as they would in their own homes.  The guests we served were so much more than just customers to us, they were our friends and our families. True personal connection like that is the foundation that you can build incredible friendships and relationships on. I am pleased to say that some of the people that are most near and dear to me today came from my days of working at Starbucks.

            I had always enjoyed my jobs in the past, but Wayne’s Auto Sales taught me what it was like to absolutely love a job.  I oversaw creating and updating the social media accounts as well as the company website while also filming and producing all the video advertisements. I had never had a job where I had so much fun.  I honestly kind of felt bad for my co-workers because for them it was “just a job”, for me it was like having one exciting day after another.  It wasn’t always like that though. When I first began my employment, the company had very little internet presence and much of the advertising that happened was solely from word of mouth being spread throughout the community.  I was tasked with trying to change that. They had never tried internet-based video advertisements before and even though I had never tried video or audio editing before, it was decided that I should give it a try. I took on the responsibility of trying to teach myself as much about the subject as I could.  I’ve never had any formal training in media production, but I found it to be more fun than I ever imagined. I found that I got great fulfillment and satisfaction from taking an idea, drawing up the plans for the idea, filming the vehicles, editing the video and audio, and ultimately modifying HTML and CSS code of the company’s website so that I could upload the finalized promotional film for our customers to watch and enjoy. I enjoyed being able to take an idea out of my imagination, put it on film and then edit it and the website in such a way for it to display the video for all our customers to see.  George Bernard Shaw once said, “Imagination is the beginning of creation.” At Wayne’s Auto Sales, I got to experience that on a daily basis. It was here that I developed my first curiosity in coding. Seeing my hard work have a direct connection to an increase in total sales and revenue really inspired me to push myself further down this path.

            Early 2021 my partner and I decided to relocate us and our dogs from Birmingham, AL to Clermont, FL. I decided to take the opportunity to make a career change.  I have a programmer friend who had suggested that I try a simple HTML course to see if I liked it or not.  I don't think "Hello World" had even appeared on the screen before I knew that I was in love with coding and that it’s what I wanted to do with my life.  I spent the first few months that we were living in our new home watching tutorials and reading materials trying to get started. In September 2021 I enrolled in the University of Central Florida’s Full Stack Web Development Boot Camp where my growth as a programmer really got started.  It was extremely tough work, oftentimes exceeding 70-80 hours of work per week, but it was fun work.  I had never had so much fun getting so little sleep before, but it was worth it to be able to maintain an A+ average throughout the entire course.  They taught us a lot of extremely useful skills, technologies and programming languages. Many of which I have used to create some pretty neat projects if I do say so myself.  Going into it, I thought it would be years before I could create an employee tracker or a weather dashboard but within the first few weeks I had.  If those were built so quickly into my coding education, then what other exciting projects lay just around the corner?  
            <br>
            <br>
            It’s funny though because the more I learned about coding and programming with modern computers, the more I was reminded of the simple hammer and wood that I use to build projects with as a child.  The only difference is that the medium and tools had changed but besides that the two were very similar in concept, HTML now the wood and JavaScript now the hammer.  In some ways I found that coding seems to be the culmination of every part of my life that has come before it. My lifelong obsession has always been to create something from nothing and now, through the use of raw data, words and numbers, I’ve found that I have the potential to build nearly limitless possibilities. My imagination and mind is now limited only by the constraints of the web browser or desktop.   Anything my imagination can create is now becoming possible for me to build. By paying attention to the smallest details, I now have the potential to build environments that can exceed people’s expectations and experiences. Accuracy and precision are required for every line of code, there’s no room for errors or mishaps when you are building the digital face for someone or their business.  They want a high set of standards for the quality of the product that they need, I’m excited and hopeful to be the one to try to exceed those standards. Showing people that they can trust you and depend on you is one of the best ways to establish lasting relationships and business partnerships.

            I am very excited about programming and development.  While I may lack the college degree to back up that love, I am very enthusiastic about learning new skills and abilities. I am a hard worker who doesn’t believe in a problem that can’t be overcome.  I’m always looking for any opportunities to grow as a person and expand my capabilities by meeting and exceeding any challenges or tasks put in front of me. If you have anything that I can assist you with, please feel free to contact me so we can discuss it further.
