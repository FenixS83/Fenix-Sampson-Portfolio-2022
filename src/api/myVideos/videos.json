        "notes": "This video was a ton of fun to make. I experimented with using B-roll footage to compliment the vehicle, as well as to hide the vehicle leading up to the final full body beauty shot.  I experimented with using some of the vehicles automated features to help convey a better sense of motion to the shots beyond just the camera moving.  I experimented with performing a quick reverse backing away from the camera, then reversed the footage to make it appear as though the car was speeding towards the camera instead.  I experimented with filming from several new angles that I had not tried before including of the car driving down the road as well as having the camera mounted to the top of the vehicle while it was in motion.
